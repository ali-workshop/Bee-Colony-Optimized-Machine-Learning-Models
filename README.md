🐝 BCO-ML Optimizer
Enhancing Machine Learning Models via Bee Colony Optimization
Nature-inspired swarm intelligence for hyperparameter tuning and feature selection in classification/regression tasks.
📌 Overview
This project implements Bee Colony Optimization (BCO), a swarm intelligence algorithm, to optimize machine learning models. It automates:

Hyperparameter tuning (e.g., for SVM, Random Forest, Neural Networks)

Feature selection (reducing dimensionality while preserving accuracy)

Model training (benchmarked against grid search, PSO, and GA)

✨ Key Features
Bio-inspired Optimization: Mimics honeybee foraging behavior for efficient parameter search.

ML Framework Support: Compatible with scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch.

Modular Design: Plug-and-play BCO for your existing ML pipelines.

Visual Analytics: Plot convergence curves and solution space exploration.

🚀 Quick Start
Installation
